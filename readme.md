LearningRewards
 Project Description
LearningRewards is a blockchain-based platform that incentivizes users to enhance their knowledge by completing learning modules. The platform uses its native ERC20 token, LearningRewardsToken (LRT), to reward users for successfully completing educational tasks. This decentralized approach ensures transparency, fairness, and engagement in learning processes.
